Canada is in the middle of a public health crisis due to the harm of opioids, stimulants, and other psychoactive substances. In this project, I choose to focus on the data related to deaths that covers the time period from 2018 to 2022, in three provinces: Nova Scotia, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. 
The dataset offers valuable insights to tackle this crisis.

## The DATA

The data for this project was extracted from the InfoBase of the Health Agency of Canada. 
You can access the datasets from the links below: 
-	<a href= "https://health-infobase.canada.ca/substance-related-harms/opioids-stimulants/">the Federal, provincial, and territorial Special Advisory Committee on the Epidemic of Opioid Overdoses</a><br/>
## Objectives
The objective of this project is to display the data from the 3 provinces in an interactive dashboard to be able to compare them and to have insights about the opioid crisis in each provinces.

## Techniques Used 
1.	Data Cleaning
2.	Data Modelling: PowerQuery
3.	PivotTables
4.	PivotCharts
5.	Slicers
6.	Functions: SUMIFS
7.	Conditional Formatting




## QUESTIONS TO ANSWER
1-	How did the death toll compare between the 4 provinces?<br/>
2-	What is the death toll of stimulants compared to opioids? <br/>
3-	What are the demographic specificities of the opioid’s crisis? <br/>
4-	What is the origin of opioids and what kind of opioids are involved in opioid-related deaths?<br/>
5-	 What type of stimulants are involved?<br/>



## DATA ANALYSIS

#### 1 - How did the death toll compare between the 4 provinces?
The number of opioids-related deaths has increased steadily in Ontario, Alberta, and BC starting 2019 until 2021. After 2021 we notice a sharp decline.
Regarding Nova Scotia, the number of deaths stayed almost the same.

#### 2-	What is the death toll of stimulants compared to opioids?
Opioids are responsible of far more deaths in the 4 provinces than stimulants.
Opioids are responsible for nearly 40,000 cumulative deaths in Ontario. There is no data about stimulants deaths in Alberta.

#### 3 - What are the demographic specificities of the opioid crisis?
In all 4 provinces, Males represent mor than 2 thirds of opioids-related deaths. The highest male rate is in British Columbia where males are 75% among the victims. 
The same tendency can be observed with stimulants. 
The data available related to age groups is a national data and it shows that young people between 30 – 39 year-old are 27% among victims, followed by the 40-49 y-o by 23.2%.

#### 4	- What is the origin of opioids and what kind of opioids are involved in opioid-related deaths?
The non-pharmaceuticals opioids are the dominant cause of opioid-related deaths by more than 75% of cases.

#### 5- What type of stimulants are involved?
The cocaine is the main cause of deaths by stimulants in Canada and in the different provinces of our study by more being involved in more than 70 % of the cases.
Methamphetamines are the second most common stimulants found in stimulants-related deaths.

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals that opioid-related deaths have steadily increased in Ontario, Alberta, and British Columbia until 2021, while Nova Scotia's figures remained relatively stable. Opioids, particularly fentanyl, were implicated in over 75% of these deaths, with males constituting the majority of the victims. The data indicates that non-pharmaceutical opioids are the predominant cause, contrasting with stimulant-related deaths, where cocaine is the leading factor. This evidence points to the need for province-specific strategies that address the dominant substances and affected demographics to effectively mitigate this public health crisis.
